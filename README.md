Open Source Technical Analysis Library for Python

It should be ideal for -

* Individual calculators which work perfectly as indiviuals and perform as well in a collective library to suit everyones need with out any dependence on external languages.

* Selective installation instead of the whole package with dependencies - which break with upgrades.[Even if they do, a user can upgrade the formula/e by simple search or download the latest version when available]

Ideal state would be

* to provide a Deep-Learning alogrithm or Machine-Learning algorithm for users to use which can, in future, assist with probabilities, accuracy and precision - to enable real-time decision making.
* that the library becomes learned enough to independently review latest Python releases, update code of this base; based on AI, DL, ML. And is self testing and certified to be good for public consumption. Off course devoid of any human interference.
Hope we all benefit.
